2,deep-dive-into-react,"A Deep Dive into React Hooks","John Smith","2023-10-27","https://picsum.photos/seed/2/1200/600","React Hooks have revolutionized how we write components. They let us use state and other React features without writing a class.\n\nIn this post, we'll explore some of the most common hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext`.\n\nWe will also look at how to create our own custom hooks to encapsulate and reuse stateful logic. This is a powerful pattern that can make your code much cleaner and easier to reason about."

However, once you get used to the workflow, it becomes incredibly productive.\n\nLet's build a few components together and see how Tailwind's mobile-first approach and flexible customization options can speed up your development process significantly."

In this article, we'll explore the ecosystem of modern SSGs and discuss why they are a great choice for many types of websites."
